## NeuroMorph: A High-Temporal Resolution MEG Dataset for Morpheme-Based Linguistic Analysis

**TL;DR:** We present NeuroMorph: neural data of 24 high-resolution MEG recordings capturing real-time processing of multi-morphemic words with over 17 hours of data from a lexical decision task, which can help improve cognitive modeling and NLP.
